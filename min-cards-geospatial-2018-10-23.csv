Positive,"I loved the dplyr workshop, it was very helpful"
Positive,"Time management, breaks, challenges, food"
Positive,"I really enjoyed the visuals and examples, the pace was easy to follow"
Positive,"I like that there was a refresher R at the start (Day 2), the instructor's speed was good"
Positive,"the challenges were helpful, slow pace of some instructors, instructors very helpful"
Positive,Good introduction to grid(?) and raster
Positive,multiple ways to do one certain job is interesting to know
Positive,All the teachers explained everything very well
Positive,Always good workshop
Positive,"Intro to basics of R was good, I am very new to R"
Positive,"Applicable content, good pace"
Positive,"All the instructors are really nice, good time to review R, thank you!"
Positive,So far enjoying the workshop!
Positive,All the instructors are very knowledgeable and it was easy to follow their lectures
Positive,Really helpful
Positive,"Really enjoyed the dplyr section, this will be very helpful for me in my work"
Positive,Great workshop!
Positive,I learned a lot about geospatial thins I never knew!
Positive,"I loved making raster maps today, and learning to combine data types"
Positive,"instructors were great, length of workshop was perfect, lots of helpers especially given the number of students, content was great"
Positive,Great workshop! Thanks for the great help!!
Positive,All lessons were awesome today
Positive,Excellent job
Positive,"It was really helpful for me, thank you"
Positive,"Easy to follow instructions, basic concepts well explained, really nice environment, very friendly, thanks!"
Positive,"Instructors do a great job for introductory course, it is good to have online resources to go at our own speed"
Positive,"Really, today was great. Every part of today was interesting. y'all know when to make breaks, you're so helpful. It was great"
Positive,Well done!
Positive,Everything! Everyone is incredibly helpful
Positive,It was hard to find some of he online lectures because they don't follow a general index
Positive,Really good
Improvement,"Less of an intro to R, a little slower on the geospatial"
Improvement,Please allow us to have the original script
Improvement,probably less R intro is needed to allow finishing all activities
Improvement,"Some sections too repetitive, especially if very familiar with ggplot. Would be good to specify audience for workshop, for someone that works with R a lot and ggplot, dplyr, etc... it might be a bit slow. But this is easily addressed by having a set schedule/contents online"
Improvement,"Don't cover Intro to R, should be part of other workshop"
Improvement,"Maybe give an overview of where to get shape and raster files (general resources), explain better the structure of shape & raster files"
Improvement,"I think the Day 1 topics should be covered by each student separately (like sending the code and classes ahead) and dedicate 2 days on just working with geospatial data. Maybe having 2 hours to check our data, or have additional examples, reading external files. Maybe important to comment a little bit more the coding because we will like to remember sometimes in a quick way what the lines are doing."
Improvement,I was expecting more info in spatial analysis and maybe in the future people can go over the basics of R online and focus this workshop on spatial data only (the whole 2 days)
Improvement,"Maybe less intro to R, make it strictly geospatial data"
Improvement,A bit fast today (day 2)
Improvement,"slow start, fast finish"
Improvement,"I already had plenty of experience in R, it would be better to more focus on geospatial analysis for the people who are familiar with R, but thank you!"
Improvement,"Some points were a little too slow, but they were important to people that are not familiar with R"
Improvement,"I'd split the workshop into people who experience in R and don't, it was a lot of review"
Improvement,"R intro too long (I would have skipped), a ppt or more organized presentation would have been useful for the geospatial concepts intro for those new to geography"
Improvement,"Possibly too much background R, however this workshop is for beginners"
Improvement,"More data, more plot types"
Improvement,Fast pace of some instructors
Improvement,"The morning session of basic set-up is a little bit too long, which makes the rest of the workshop a little bit in a rush"
Improvement,"Less R intro, more time for geospatial, and slower"
Improvement,"Maybe do not cover R intro in this workshop, have pre-req to ask folks to get into this workshop they already have intro R"
Improvement,"Got faster or cut the intro a little bit, schedule people that know the R intro to arrive after"
Improvement,"Maybe an icebreaker at the beginning to know each background or names, the classes were in the Data Carpentry website so maybe saying this at the beginning to also follow a little bit the graphs and codes"
Improvement,Introduction to dplyr & ggplot could have been better with interesting challenging examples
